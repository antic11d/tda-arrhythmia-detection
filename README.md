# Topological data analysis approach in arrhythmia detection
Deep learning in combibantion with topological data analysis approach for monitoring heart conditions from ECG signals, presented in [[Dindin, Umeda, Chazal 2020](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02155849/file/1906.05795.pdf)]. Convolutional network is used for classification of the Betti curves, presented in [[Umeda 2016](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjsai/32/3/32_D-G72/_pdf)]. Approach is experimented on a family of open-source data sets provided by PhysioNet platform ([MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm](https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/) and [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)).
